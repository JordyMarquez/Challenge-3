# Password Generator Starter Code
## Description 
The purpose of this project was to create a password generator using javascript. The HTML and CSS files were not edited besides some minor restructuring of the files. To create a password generator, the user was prompted to select criteria (length, using numbers, uppercase or lowercase letters, symbols) and a password was created. The selected criteria was formed using concated arrays and was randomized using a sort and math.random function. After which, the length of the password was created using a for loop depending on the user's selected length.
